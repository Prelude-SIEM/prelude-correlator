Basic Installation
==================

   Briefly, the shell commands `python setup.py install' should
configure, build, and install this package. See the `README' file for
instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
necessarily a bug.
