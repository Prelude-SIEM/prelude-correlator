* 2008-07-11, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta3:

- Add missing AUTHORS file.

- Allow setting 'nil' IDMEF value using IDMEF:set() (#297). 

- Fix ctx:set() typo in the business-hour.lua rulese (#297).


* 2008-07-03, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta2:

- Fix issues with the business-hour ruleset, that tried updating a non
  existing context. This rule does not need a context at all, rather a
  simple IDMEF object is sufficiant.

- Always return a table when retrieving multiple path (even
  with empty path). Fix #295.

- Correct multi-path detection (was not working with exactly two IDMEF
  path).
    
- Fix invalid installation path under certain conditions, thanks
  to Steve Grubb <sgrubb@redhat.com> for pointing that out.


* 2008-06-27, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta1b:

- Fix invalid installation path under certain conditions.


* 2008-06-27, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta1a:

- Check for lua.pc as well as lua5.1.pc, since different distribution
  seems to be using different default.

- First Prelude-Correlator release.
