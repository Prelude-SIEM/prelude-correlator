* 2009-06-18, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta4:

- A bug prevented prelude-correlator from starting in daemon mode when
  using the '--pidfile' option. Fixes #355.

- Prevent prelude-correlator from abording if a plugin fail. Emit
  a warning explaining why a given plugin couldn't load, and continue
  processing.

- Implement a timeout for Dshield.org server connection. The default
  is 10 seconds, and might be modified from the prelude-correlator.conf
  configuration file. This prevent Dshield host list loading from
  blocking forever, and fixes #353.

- Make it possible to disable plugin (fixes #354), by adding the following setting
  in prelude-correlator.conf:

  [PluginClassName]
  disable = true

- Read plugin configuration from prelude-correlator.conf

- Use the Python logging facility.

- Correct copyright notice, add missing AUTHORS, COPYING, HACKING.README files.



* 2009-06-17, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta4:

- Initial Python Correlator version. Rationale for the switch available here:
  http://lists.prelude-ids.org/pipermail/prelude-user/2009-April/005163.html

- Support DShield <http://www.dshield.org/> correlation!


* 2008-07-11, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta3:

- Add missing AUTHORS file.

- Allow setting 'nil' IDMEF value using IDMEF:set() (#297).

- Fix ctx:set() typo in the business-hour.lua rulese (#297).


* 2008-07-03, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta2:

- Fix issues with the business-hour ruleset, that tried updating a non
  existing context. This rule does not need a context at all, rather a
  simple IDMEF object is sufficiant.

- Always return a table when retrieving multiple path (even
  with empty path). Fix #295.

- Correct multi-path detection (was not working with exactly two IDMEF
  path).

- Fix invalid installation path under certain conditions, thanks
  to Steve Grubb <sgrubb@redhat.com> for pointing that out.


* 2008-06-27, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta1b:

- Fix invalid installation path under certain conditions.


* 2008-06-27, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta1a:

- Always use $(DESTDIR) when installing files.

- Check for lua.pc as well as lua5.1.pc, since different distribution
  seems to be using different default.


* 2008-06-27, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta1:

- First Prelude-Correlator release.
