- Improved exception handling

- Support IDMEF Alert merge, to avoid CorrelationAlert listing
  the same source multiples times

- Allow pluginmanager API to be used with multiples entrypoints

    A Prelude-Correlator plugin may now use the pluginmanager API with
    their own entrypoint to load their own sub-plugins.

- Allow plugin to specify a list of conflicting plugins

    Using this interface, a plugin can now provide a list of other plugins
    that conflict with him, and that shouldn't be loaded.
    Additionally, provide a way for the user to force loading of a plugin
    that was disabled because of a conflict (using enable = force in the
    configuration section for the plugin).

- Add autoload attribute to the generic Plugin class

    This attribute controls whether PluginManager() will directly load a given
    plugin or only references the plugin class for later loading. Default behavior
    is to load the plugins.

- Various timer improvements

- Add an option to read IDMEF input from file,
  within the given offset / limit

- Add a stats() function which can be used by a plugin
  to provide statistics printing

- Implement GetAdditionalDataByMeaning() method

- Fixed #494 : Prelude Correlator not stopping

- Changed Copyright

- Added packaging for rhel6

- Ability to specify an input IDMEF criteria

  There is now a [general] configuration section in prelude-correlator.conf
  allowing to specify a criteria option that use an IDMEF criteria parameter
  as an argument.
    
  Using this option, it is possible to specify an input filter for events
  to be processed by the correlator.
    
  Additionally, always use an IDMEFCriteria to check whether the input
  event is an alert, in place of manually retrieving alert.create_time.

- Fixed some typo

- Implement Context time merging capability
    
  Introduced time merging capability within Prelude-Correlator:
  as of now, correlation contexts are associated with the time of the
  triggering IDMEF event.
    
  When searching for a matching context, an existing context will only be
  returned in case the specified search time match the time windows of an
  existing context.
    
  This mean that when receiving a burst of events, the time carried with
  events is directly taken into account : separate instances exists for
  the same Context associated with events received at a different time.
    
  Additionally, context can be merged if more than one context time windows
  overlap.


* 2010-03-16, prelude-correlator-1.0.0:

- When Prelude-Correlator is started as a daemon, make sure we use
  syslog for logging.

- Fix an exception when adding an alert with no source or target to the
  generated Correlation alert, by Frédéric Yhuel
  <fyhuel@prelude-technologies.com>

- Do not generate Brute Force CorrelationAlert for multiples successful
  authentication.

- Workaround documentation installation problem.


* 2010-03-08, prelude-correlator-1.0.0rc4:

- Fix installation problem (#372).


* 2010-03-05, prelude-correlator-1.0.0rc3:

- Prelude-Correlator wasn't properly updating context (and thus, didn't
  generate correlation events) since context identifiers were escaped
  twice.

- Prevent exception when Prelude-Correlator attempt to restore contexts
  from an earlier Prelude-Correlator version, and that the context
  internal attributes have changed.

- A sample-plugin example has been included in the distribution.


* 2010-02-01, prelude-correlator-1.0.0rc2:

- Fix generated tarball name, so that the package might easily be
  included in various distribution for testing.


* 2010-01-29, prelude-correlator-1.0.0rc1:

- [Firewall]: The plugin will now report CorrelationAlert for events /
  sets of events that appear to have passed through a firewall known to
  protect the target machine. If no firewall ever emit block concerning
  a given host, then this host is considered un-protected, and there is
  no point in reporting CorrelationAlert.

- [OpenSSHAuth]: The plugin has been modified so that it can now
  generate a single CorrelationAlert for multiples authentication method
  used in a given time slice.

- [Spamhaus]: The plugin has been modified so that it can now generate a
  single CorrelationAlert for multiples events received from the same
  source.

- [BruteForce]: Various improvement, do not limit the number of events
  the plugin is able to report in a single CorrelationAlert.

- [Scan]: do not limit the number of events the plugin is able to report
  in a single CorrelationAlert.

- Context initialization now take an optional 'overwrite' argument. This
  argument, if set to False, mean that the Context() will be returned
  un-modified if it already exist. If it doesn't, it will be created.

- New Context.update() method, which provide exactly the same
  functionality as calling Context() with the 'update=True' argument.
  This is useful since some plugin need to defer an update to another
  place in the code.

- If the context creation/update function is called with an IDMEF message
  parameter, then we automatically call addAlertReference on the context
  CorrelationAlert using the provided message as the parameter.

- Make it possible to change context option on update

- Automatically set CorrelationAlert DetectTime : reported
  CorrelationAlert DetectTime now match the time of the first event that
  was detected.

- Make it possible for plugin to specify a function to be called on
  Timer expiration.

- Disable BusinessHour correlation by default since it is very verbose

- Various bug fixes.


* 2009-11-03, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta8:

- Include spamhaus_drop.dat in the source distribution. Fix installation
  issue (closes #364).


* 2009-11-02, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta7:

- Initial SpamhausDrop plugin implementation, by
  Wes Young <wes@barely3am.com> (closes #363)

- Do not discard --root parameters if prefix is absolute.

- Python 2.4 backward compatibility fixes.

- Handle plugin loading error gracefully.

- Improve WormPlugin accuracy, and make it carry a reference to the
  initial event. The plugin used to alert when seeing an alert to a
  given target, and this same alert going back to the source. This can
  happen in a number of case (example: Netbios alert triggered by Snort)

  As of now, the plugin will wait for the events to be repeated against
  at least 5 differents hosts.

- Dshield CorrelationAlert now handle multiples events. Previously, we
  used to generate a single Dshield CorrelationAlert for each events
  where the source address would match the Dshield database. The plugin
  now generate CorrelationAlert for multiples events received from the
  same source.


* 2009-07-09, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta6:

- Provide a default configuration file, and fixes the prelude-correlator
  --config option.

- A rare exception could occur when IDMEF:Set() was called with
  an empty list/tuple as the value argument.

- Normalize libprelude logging through our own log callback (only
  enabled if libprelude >= 0.9.24 is installed).

- The DShield plugin didn't report any events since address loaded
  from the DShield database weren't correctly normalized.

- Automatic download + reloading of the DShield database was fixed.

- DShield generated alerts now include additional details.

- Make it possible to specify your own DShield database file, and to
  prevent automatic download. This is useful on system with no direct
  internet access.

- Handle both standard installation, and EGG installation method (in EGG
  mode, configuration and data files are self contained).

- Introduce a new plugin logging mechanism.

- Add some utility method to the Timer class.

- Make it possible for plugin to define a 'signal' method that will
  get called when prelude-correlator handle a signal (can be used to
  perform special handling before exit, statistics or debugging
  purposes).


* 2009-06-18, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta5:

- A bug prevented prelude-correlator from starting in daemon mode when
  using the '--pidfile' option. Fixes #355.

- Prevent prelude-correlator from abording if a plugin fail. Emit
  a warning explaining why a given plugin couldn't load, and continue
  processing.

- Implement a timeout for Dshield.org server connection. The default
  is 10 seconds, and might be modified from the prelude-correlator.conf
  configuration file. This prevent Dshield host list loading from
  blocking forever, and fixes #353.

- Make it possible to disable plugin (fixes #354), by adding the following setting
  in prelude-correlator.conf:

  [PluginClassName]
  disable = true

- Read plugin configuration from prelude-correlator.conf

- Use the Python logging facility.

- Correct copyright notice, add missing AUTHORS, COPYING, HACKING.README files.



* 2009-06-17, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta4:

- Initial Python Correlator version. Rationale for the switch available here:
  http://lists.prelude-ids.org/pipermail/prelude-user/2009-April/005163.html

- Support DShield <http://www.dshield.org/> correlation!


* 2008-07-11, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta3:

- Add missing AUTHORS file.

- Allow setting 'nil' IDMEF value using IDMEF:set() (#297).

- Fix ctx:set() typo in the business-hour.lua rulese (#297).


* 2008-07-03, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta2:

- Fix issues with the business-hour ruleset, that tried updating a non
  existing context. This rule does not need a context at all, rather a
  simple IDMEF object is sufficiant.

- Always return a table when retrieving multiple path (even
  with empty path). Fix #295.

- Correct multi-path detection (was not working with exactly two IDMEF
  path).

- Fix invalid installation path under certain conditions, thanks
  to Steve Grubb <sgrubb@redhat.com> for pointing that out.


* 2008-06-27, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta1b:

- Fix invalid installation path under certain conditions.


* 2008-06-27, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta1a:

- Always use $(DESTDIR) when installing files.

- Check for lua.pc as well as lua5.1.pc, since different distribution
  seems to be using different default.


* 2008-06-27, prelude-correlator-0.9.0-beta1:

- First Prelude-Correlator release.
