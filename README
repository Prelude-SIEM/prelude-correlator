Prelude-Correlator: The Prelude-Correlator.
Prelude-Correlator is brought to you by CS GROUP (http://www.csgroup.eu).


Prelude-Correlator Overview
===========================

Prelude-Correlator allows conducting multistream correlations thanks to a powerful programming 
language for writing correlation rules. With any type of alert able to be correlated, event 
analysis becomes simpler, quicker and more incisive.
