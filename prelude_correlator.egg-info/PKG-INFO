Description: 
        Prelude-Correlator perform real time correlation of events received by Prelude.
        
        Several isolated alerts, generated from different sensors, can thus
        trigger a single CorrelationAlert should the events be related. This
        CorrelationAlert then appears within the Prewikka interface and
        indicates the potential target information via the set of correlation
        rules.
        
        Signature creation with Prelude-Correlator is based on the Python
        programming language. Prelude's integrated correlation engine is
        distributed with a default set of correlation rules, yet you still
        have the opportunity to modify and create any correlation rule that
        suits your needs.
